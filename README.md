# Automobile-Data-Analysis-Classifying-MPG-Efficiency-with-ML-Models

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze automobile data and classify vehicles based on Miles Per Gallon (MPG) efficiency using various Machine Learning models. The dataset contains features like cylinders, horsepower, weight, displacement, etc., to predict and categorize MPG efficiency into different classes.
🏆 Objectives
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features
•	Apply data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values & scaling
•	Train multiple Machine Learning models for MPG classification
•	Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
•	Provide insights into factors affecting fuel efficiency
